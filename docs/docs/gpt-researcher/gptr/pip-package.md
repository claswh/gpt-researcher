🌟 **Exciting News!** Now, you can integrate `gpt-researcher` with your apps seamlessly!

## Steps to Install GPT Researcher

Follow these easy steps to get started:

0. **Pre-requisite**: Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed on your machine 💻
1. **Install gpt-researcher**: Grab the official package from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/gpt-researcher/).

```bash
pip install gpt-researcher
```

2. **Environment Variables:** Create a .env file with your OpenAI API key or simply export it

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY={Your OpenAI API Key here}
```

```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY={Your Tavily API Key here}
```

3. **Start using GPT Researcher in your own codebase**

## Example Usage 📝

```python
from gpt_researcher import GPTResearcher
import asyncio


from gpt_researcher import GPTResearcher
import asyncio


async def get_report(query: str, report_type: str) -> str:
    researcher = GPTResearcher(query, report_type)
    research_result = await researcher.conduct_research()
    report = await researcher.write_report()
    return report

if __name__ == "__main__":
    query = "what team may win the NBA finals?"
    report_type = "research_report"

    report = asyncio.run(get_report(query, report_type))
    print(report)
```

## Specific Examples 🌐

### Example 1: Research Report 📚

```python
query = "Latest developments in renewable energy technologies"
report_type = "research_report"
```

### Example 2: Resource Report 📋

```python
query = "List of top AI conferences in 2023"
report_type = "resource_report"
```

### Example 3: Outline Report 📝

```python
query = "Outline for an article on the impact of AI in education"
report_type = "outline_report"
```

## Integration with Web Frameworks 🌍

### FastAPI Example

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from gpt_researcher import GPTResearcher
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/report/{report_type}")
async def get_report(query: str, report_type: str) -> dict:
    researcher = GPTResearcher(query, report_type)
    research_result = await researcher.conduct_research()
    report = await researcher.write_report()
    return {"report": report}

# Run the server
# uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Flask Example

**Pre-requisite**: Install flask with the async extra.

```bash
pip install 'flask[async]'
```

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from gpt_researcher import GPTResearcher

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/report/<report_type>', methods=['GET'])
async def get_report(report_type):
    query = request.args.get('query')
    researcher = GPTResearcher(query, report_type)
    research_result = await researcher.conduct_research()
    report = await researcher.write_report()
    return report

# Run the server
# flask run
```
**Run the server**

```bash
flask run
```

**Example Request**

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/report/research_report?query=what team may win the nba finals?"
```

**Note**: The above code snippets are just examples. You can customize them as per your requirements.

## Getters and Setters
If you're interested in getting more details about the research, you can use the following getters:

### Get Research Sources
Sources are the URLs that were used to gather information for the research.
```python
source_urls = researcher.get_source_urls()
```

### Get Research Context
Context is all the retrieved information from the research. It includes the sources and their corresponding content.
```python
research_context = researcher.get_research_context()
```

### Get Research Costs
Costs are the number of tokens consumed during the research process.
```python
research_costs = researcher.get_costs()
```

### Set Verbose
You can set the verbose mode to get more detailed logs.
```python
researcher.set_verbose(True)
```

### Add Costs
You can also add costs to the research process if you want to track the costs from external usage.
```python
researcher.add_costs(0.22)
```
